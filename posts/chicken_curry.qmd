Add the sliced onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.
Add the ginger-garlic paste and green chilies, and sauté until the raw smell disappears.
Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft and the oil starts to separate.
Add the prepared masala paste, coriander powder, and garam masala. Sauté for a couple of minutes.
Add the marinated chicken pieces and mix well to coat them with the masala.
